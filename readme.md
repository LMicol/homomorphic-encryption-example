## Homomorphic encryption example

----

This is an example of execution of machine learning with homomorphic encryption.

The code is write in Python 3.9, be sure to run the command bellow to have the requirements installed.

```Shell
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**THIS CODE IS NOT MINE**

I've merged the execution into one single notebook to make a better step-by-step interpretation.
